- Used MNIST and CROHME data.
- Trained a Tensorflow CNN to recognize written digits
- OpenCV for vision computations

Credits to :
- Create data other than MNIST https://github.com/karan1149/crohme-data-extractor/blob/master/extract.py
- Some work to follow the finger : https://github.com/amarlearning/Finger-Detection-and-Tracking
